      Sydney facilitates secure transactions between buyers and vendors, with
      shipping handled by individual vendors. This Shipping Policy outlines the
      process, responsibilities, and expectations for shipping on our platform.
      By using Sydney, you agree to these terms.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 1: Shipping Overview -->
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4">
      1. Shipping Overview
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
      Sydney does not handle shipping directly. Vendors are responsible for
      shipping physical goods to buyers after an order is placed and payment is
      secured in escrow. Shipping methods, costs, and timelines vary by vendor
      and are detailed in product listings or communicated via encrypted
      messaging.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 2: How Shipping Works -->
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4">
      2. How Shipping Works
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">The shipping process follows these steps:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 mb-6">
      <li>
        <strong>Order Placement:</strong> Buyers place an order and send Bitcoin
        to the escrow address provided.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Payment Confirmation:</strong> Once payment is confirmed, the
        order status updates to "paid," and the vendor is notified.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vendor Ships Item:</strong> The vendor prepares and ships the
        item, marking the order as "shipped" on Sydney, and may provide tracking
        details via encrypted messages (optional, depending on vendor policy).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Delivery:</strong> Buyers receive the item and confirm receipt
        by releasing escrow funds to the vendor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Escrow Release:</strong> Funds are released to the vendor after
        10 days when the buyer has confirm receive of the order.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Section 3: Vendor Responsibilities -->

    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
      Returns are handled by vendors per their individual policies. Refunds are
      processed via escrow: - If an item is not delivered or arrives defective,
      funds may be returned to the buyer’s Bitcoin address after dispute
      resolution. - Once escrow is released to the vendor, refunds are between
      the buyer and vendor directly.
